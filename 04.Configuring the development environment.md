## Configuring the development environment

**Note:** this part is optional. If you don’t want to work with an IDE, you can skip this part.

Writing JavaScript code in a simple text editor will quickly become tedious and be the source of many syntax errors without a checking tool. The advantage of an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code for JavaScript 2](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) is that it offers syntax highlighting, but above all **[auto-completion 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete) mechanisms** that will save you a huge amount of time.

The procedure for **configuring the development environment** is as follows:

1. From a terminal, install the NodeJS package of [`Obsidian API` 11](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obsidian).
    
2. Launch Visual Studio Code, then open your Obsidian vault folder.
    
3. In the folder where the CustomJS scripts folder is already located, create a file named `jsconfig.json`. This allows you to [configure a JavaScript project in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) to take advantage of auto-completion with the Obsidian API and JavaScript.
    
4. Paste the following content into this file:
    

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "module": "ESNext", "moduleResolution": "Bundler", "target": "ES2022", "jsx": "react", "allowImportingTsExtensions": true, "checkJs": true, "allowJs": true, "experimentalDecorators": true, "strictNullChecks": true, "strictFunctionTypes": true, "baseUrl": ".", "paths": { "obsidian": ["../../../../../.nvm/versions/node/v20.13.1/lib/node_modules/obsidian/obsidian.d.ts"], "custom-js": ["../.obsidian/plugins/customjs/types.d.ts"] } }, "exclude": [ "node_modules", "**/node_modules/*" ] }
```

5. In the `obsidian` variable, check that the path points to the type definition in the Obsidian NodeJS package.

You should now have auto-completion when developing scripts. In the rest of the guide, we’ll be coming back to modify this file to add our scripts in order to have auto-completion on our own classes.

> **Suggestion**  
> Put the `// @ts-check` instruction at the beginning of each JavaScript file to detect syntax errors.
