## Externalise JavaScript code in script files

Writing all the JavaScript code only in markdown files will quickly make your files unreadable, and above all, make code maintenance difficult and lead to a lot of redundancy. That’s why it’s recommended that you move it to script files located in a subfolder of the Obsidian vault, then invoke them in the markdown pages using the [CustomJS plugin 47](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js).

The **approach to outsourcing code** is as follows:

1. In Obsidian, create a sub-folder for the JavaScript files. For example, in my case it’s `03-Files/scripts_customjs`, next to my other assets.

2. In the Obsidian options, go to the CustomJS configuration parameters.
    
3. Initialise the _Folder_ parameter with the path to the folder created earlier (for example `03-Files/scripts_customjs`). Close the options window.
    
4. Using File Explorer, open this folder, then create a new file suffixed with the `.js` extension. For example `my-script.js`. The filename _must not_ contain any spaces or special characters.
    
5. Using a text editor or code-editing software, open this file and paste the following demonstration code:
    

```javascript
class MacroGuide { /** * @param {Object} dv DataView object of Obisidian extension. */ helloWorld(dv) { const { obsidian, app } = self.customJS || {}; if (obsidian == null || app == null) throw new Error("customJS is null."); dv.span( "You read the page: " + dv.fileLink(dv.current().file.path, false, "Guide for Obsidian") ) + "."; } }
```

6. Save and close the text editor.
    
7. In an Obsidian page, insert the following script invocation code:
    

````javascript
```dataviewjs customJS.MacroGuide.helloWorld(dv); ```
````

8. Switch to _Live Preview_ or _Reading_ to view the rendering. A sentence containing a link to the current page should be displayed. The rendering is identical to the first method in the previous part, but this time the business logic is externalized.

**A few comments:**

At step 6, you can see that the `helloWorld()` function is **encapsulated in a class**. This is a constraint imposed by CustomJS, which will trigger an error if it is not respected. In any way, even if this were not the case, this practice is strongly recommended to take advantage of the readability benefits offered by the Object paradigm.

Secondly, the CustomJS plugin gives access to [two objects 47](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js) which are essential for interacting with Obsidian:

- `customJS.obsidian`: provides access to the [Obsidian API 5](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/obsidian.d.ts).
- `customJS.app`: provides access to the [App object 3](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API/App).

Finally, to **access to the Dataview object from a function**, you will need to pass it the global variable `dv` as a parameter.
