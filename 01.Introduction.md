## Introduction

To structure JavaScript code in Obsidian and avoid polluting markdown files, a good practice is to externalise it in interconnected script files, and to form object classes representing conceptual entities of which only certain functions will be called in the pages. These classes will be of two types:

- **modules** : not intended to be used directly in markdown files, these classes encapsulate the business logic and make their service functions available to macros.
- **macros** : these classes act as an interface between the modules and the markdown files, and their main role is to render in HTML. Their functions are invoked in the pages using the [CustomJS plugin 47](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js).

In this guide, we will see how to run JavaScript code inside Obsidian Markdown files, and how to set up an Obsidian macro system to externalise code into dedicated script files and manage their dependencies. In addition, to make it easier to write this code, we will see how to set up a development environment.

The proposed **macro system** is not technically revolutionary. It is essentially a method of organisation for Obsidian that aims to standardise and externalise your JavaScript functions, in order to reduce code redundancy and minimise maintenance time. It is directly inspired by the [Wikipedia module and model system 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates).

### Prerequisites

This guide is written for people who are already somewhat familiar with Obsidian and who have some knowledge of JavaScript and software development. You donâ€™t need to be a software engineer, but at least have already developed a little in JavaScript and optionally know what an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) is and in particular [Visual Studio Code 1](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

For this guide you **need to install** :

- the Obsidian [_Dataview_ 7](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin for executing JavaScript in markdown pages,
- the Obsidian [_CustomJS_ 47](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js) plugin for externalizing JavaScript code and calling it.

If you want to configure a development environment, you need to **optionally install** :

- the IDE [Visual Studio Code 1](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.
- the environment [NodeJS 5](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (optional but recommended to take advantage of the auto-completion of the Obsidian API in the IDE).
