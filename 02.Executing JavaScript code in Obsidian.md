## Executing JavaScript code in Obsidian

The Dataview plugin provides [two syntaxes 2](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/dql-js-inline/#dataview-js) for embedding JavaScript in a markdown file.

The **first syntax** produces a rendering in a dedicated block (a `div`) that is separated from the text before and after it:

````markdown
```dataviewjs // here my code ```
````

For example, the following markdown code :

```markdown
Text before. ```dataviewjs dv.span("You read the page: " + dv.fileLink(dv.current().file.path, false, "Guide for Obsidian")) + "."; ``` Text after.
```

The **second syntax** is called _inline_ and produces a rendering within the text before and after :

```markdown
`$= // here my code`
```

For example, the following markdown code :

```markdown
Text before. `$= "You read the page: " + dv.fileLink(dv.current().file.path, false, "Guide for Obsidian") + ".";` Text after.
```

The **code is executed when you switch to _Live preview_ or _Reading_** view. It is therefore recommended to write it in _Source mode_.

For performance reasons, the code is not reinterpreted each time the view is changed, but at regular intervals or when modifications are made.

> **Tip**  
> To force reinterpretation of the code without modifying it, add the `;` character to the end of a line. This character is optional in JavaScript and can be found in multiple copies in a row without causing any problems. Then, when your tests are complete, delete the excess characters.
