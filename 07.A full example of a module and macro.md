## A full example of a module and macro

The proposed example is a macro called `MacroTagsOfPages`, which displays in a frame the list of tags in the `tags` property of the page. It is inspired by Wikipedia footers (as can be seen, for example, on the [Obsidian page 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software))). This macro is based on the `UtilityObsidian` module, and its style is defined by the `.macro-tags-of-page` CSS class. **The full source code is provided in the appendix**.

To **test this example in Obsidian** :

1. In the customJS scripts folder (for example `scripts_customjs`), create a file called `macro-tags-of-pages.js`, which will contain the macro `MacroTagsOfPage`, then copy the corresponding source code provided in the appendix.
    
2. Next to the CustomJS scripts folder, create a new folder called `scripts_module_common`.
    
3. In this new folder, create a file called `utility-obsidian.js`, which will contain the `UtilityObsidian` module, then copy the corresponding source code provided in the appendix.
    
4. In the Obsidian CSS snippets folder, create a new file called `macro.css` and copy the source code of the style provided in the appendix.
    
5. In an Obsidian page containing some tags, add the following code to test the macro:
    

````javascript
```dataviewjs await customJS.MacroTagsOfPage.listInBox(dv, dv.current().file.path);; ```
````

Switching to _Live Preview_ or _Reading_ view should display the rendering.
