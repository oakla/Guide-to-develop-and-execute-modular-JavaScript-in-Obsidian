## Generating HTML with JavaScript

One of the main advantages of using JavaScript in Obsidian is the ability to dynamically generate HTML content. The easiest way to do this (and perhaps the only way without a plugin) is to use the [Dataview JavaScript API 1](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/).

> **Impact on performance**  
> While executing JavaScript for data processing has very little impact on performance, this is not the case for generating HTML rendering. It can very easily add a few seconds to the loading time of a page, depending on your hardware configuration. A drop in performance is particularly noticeable when you have to generate a list containing several hundred links.

- `dv.el(element, text) : HTMLElement` : render arbitrary text in the given html element (“p”, “ul”, “li”, etc.). This function return the rendered [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement).

```javascript
dv.el("b", "This is some bold text");
```

- `dv.el(element, text, { container: HTMLElement, cls: "first-css-class second-css-class", attr: { alt: "my value" } }) : HTMLElement;` : it is possible to specify a parent [HTMLElement container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) via `container`, a custom CSS classes to add to the element via `cls`, and additional attributes via `attr`. The parent container is the Dataview container `dv.container`.

```javascript
async renderList(dv) { // Add CSS class to Dataview div block. dv.container.className += " my-css-class"; // Render a list. const div = dv.el("div", "Here is my list: ", { container: dv.container, cls: "my-class-for-list", }); const ul = dv.el("ul", "", { container: div, }); ul.innerText = ""; // a "bug" into Dataview add an extra span everywhere when there is an empty string, here we remove it. for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) dv.el("li", index, { container: ul, cls: "my-class-for-item" }); }
```

- `dv.header(level, text)` : render a header of level 1 to 6 with the given text.

```javascript
dv.header(1, "Big!"); // alias of dv.el(h1, "Big!"); dv.header(6, "Tiny");// alias of dv.el(h6, "Tiny!");
```

- `dv.paragraph(text)` : render arbitrary text in a paragraph.

```javascript
dv.paragraph("This is some text"); // alias of dv.el(p, "This is some text");
```

- `dv.span(text)` : render arbitrary text in a span (no padding above/below, unlike a paragraph).

```javascript
dv.span("This is some text"); // alias of dv.el(span, "This is some text");
```

> **Recommendation**  
> Since the last three functions are simply aliases of the first and offer fewer options than the first, I recommend using only the `dv.el()` syntax.

It is **not necessary to use these Dataview functions** to render HTML. Instead, you can go directly to the [Obsidian API](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/HTML+elements) and its `createEl()` function, accessible from a [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), as soon as you have access to the main `dv.container` container:

```javascript
const book = dv.container.createEl("div"); book.createEl("div", { text: "How to Take Smart Notes" }); book.createEl("small", { text: "Sönke Ahrens" });
```

Dataview also uses this syntax for its `dv.el()` rendering function.

Dataview provides several [functions for displaying data sets](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/#dataviews): `dv.list()`, `dv.table()` etc. These are very useful when you want to write JavaScript directly to Markdown files while limiting the number of lines of code, and its [Proxy system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) also makes it very easy to manipulate the data contained in collections. However, there are at least two limitations.

The **first limitation** is that they have **a cost in terms of performance**, which is admittedly low in terms of rendering times, but which exists despite the fact that there is a data cache. It is therefore important to understand how this system works and to identify in which cases it is relevant or not.

To handle data sets, Dataview provides a [data structure called `DataArray`](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/data-array/). Each set or subset is a `DataArray` object. You can see what this object looks like by opening the console with `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I`, then inserting and executing the following code in an Obsidian page:

````javascript
```dataviewjs console.log(dv.pages()); ```
````

This structure can be quite overkill in simple cases where, for example, you only need to list the pages present in a folder. Although Dataview’s caching system makes it easy to use, there are some cases where using the [Obsidian API 1](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API) directly is more interesting. This is why you will find **in the appendix a utility class** which provides high-level functions **to interact with the Obsidian API**.

The **second limitation** of Dataview’s dataset handling features is the impossibility of customising the rendering with a CSS class or parent container other than `dv.container`. This greatly limits the possibilities of what can be done in HTML. The only alternative is to implement the lists yourself, as we did in the previous section.
